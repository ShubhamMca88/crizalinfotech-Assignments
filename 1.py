# Question :  The time-period of a simple pendulum is 4 s and it can go to and fro from equilibriu position at a maximum distance of 10 cm. 
# If at the start of the motion the pendulum is in the position nt maximum displacement towards the right of the equilibrium position, 
# then write the displacement eguation of the pendulum.
# .........................................................solution by shubham.......................................................

import sympy as sp

# Define the time symbol
t = sp.symbols('t')

# Given values
A = 0.1  # Amplitude in meters (10 cm)
T = 4  # Time period in seconds

# Calculate the angular frequency
omega = 2 * sp.pi / T

# Phase constant Ï† is 0 because it starts at maximum displacement
phi = 0

# Displacement equation x(t) = A * cos(omega * t + phi)
x_t = A * sp.cos(omega * t + phi)

# Display the displacement equation
print(f"The displacement equation of the pendulum is: x(t) = {x_t}")
